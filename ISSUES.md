# LinkFinder Code Issues

## Bugs and Runtime Errors

1. **Unsafe Type Assertions** (lines 49, 90):
   - Using `fileInfo.Sys().(*syscall.Stat_t)` without type checking
   - Will panic on non-Unix systems where the underlying type isn't `syscall.Stat_t`
   - Fix: Add type assertion check `if stat, ok := fileInfo.Sys().(*syscall.Stat_t); ok { ... }`

## Performance Inefficiencies

1. **Missing Cancellation Context**:
   - No way to gracefully terminate long-running searches
   - Fix: Implement context.Context for cancellation

2. **Path Handling** (line 85):
   - Doesn't check if target is already an absolute path before joining
   - Fix: Use filepath.IsAbs to check if path is already absolute

3. **Symlink Handling in filepath.Walk** (lines 107-113):
   - Can lead to infinite loops with symlink cycles
   - Fix: Use filepath.WalkDir with WalkDirFunc that handles symlinks appropriately

## Logical Issues

1. **Symlink Resolution Logic** (line 39):
   - Only sends results if resolved path exactly matches target
   - Doesn't account for relative symlinks pointing to the same file
   - Fix: Compare canonical paths using filepath.Clean or os.SameFile

2. **Redundant Operations** (lines 38-44):
   - Performs both EvalSymlinks and Readlink when one might be sufficient
   - Fix: Streamline logic to reduce duplicate operations

## Missing Logic

1. **Channel Buffer Overflow**:
   - No handling for channel buffer overflow (jobs/results limited to 100)
   - Fix: Implement backpressure or dynamic buffer sizing

2. **No Rate Limiting**:
   - Could overwhelm system with too many filesystem operations
   - Fix: Add rate limiting for file system operations

3. **Directory Filtering**:
   - No mechanism to skip problematic directories (/proc, /sys, etc.)
   - Fix: Add skipDirs configuration option

## Misleading Logic

1. **Comment Placement** (lines 12-14):
   - Comments describe variables before they're declared
   - Fix: Move comments next to variable declarations

2. **Default Search Path** (line 31):
   - Default "/" searches entire filesystem without warning
   - Fix: Use current directory as default or add warning for root searches

## Security Vulnerabilities

1. **Permission Checking** (lines 107-113):
   - No check for file permissions before access attempts
   - Fix: Handle permission errors gracefully

2. **Symlink Path Traversal**:
   - No handling for symlinks pointing outside search hierarchy
   - Fix: Validate resolved paths stay within intended boundaries

## Antipatterns

1. **Global Variables**:
   - Uses globals for flags, making testing difficult
   - Fix: Refactor to use a configuration struct

2. **Single Responsibility Violation**:
   - Worker function handles multiple responsibilities
   - Fix: Split into separate functions for symlinks and hardlinks

3. **Missing Timeout**:
   - No timeout mechanism for long-running searches
   - Fix: Implement timeout with context

4. **Logging**:
   - Limited error reporting and logging
   - Fix: Add structured logging

5. **Testing**:
   - No unit tests in the codebase
   - Fix: Add tests for core functionality
